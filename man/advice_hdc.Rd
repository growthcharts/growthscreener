\description{
This function traverses a decision tree for head circumference for children
below the age of 1.
}
\details{
The decision tree assesses both single and paired measurements.
The last observations (\code{y1}) is generally taken as the
last measurement, whereas \code{y0} can be one of the previous
measurements. For more than two measurements, there are many
pairs possible, and these pairs need not be consecutive.
The \code{y0} measurement needs to be defined by the user,
and is informally taken as an earlier measurement that maximumizes
the referal probability.
